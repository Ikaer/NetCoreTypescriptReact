# NetCoreTypescriptReact

This is a very simple and basic boilerplate for a website with .net core, typescript and react.

When downloaded, an npm install must be done in folder root.

    npm install
    
To restore libman packages (react/reactdom/requirejs), right click on libman.json in visual studio then "Restore client-side libraries"
